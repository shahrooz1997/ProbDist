# Probability Project
In this project we want to develop an R library for generating random numbers.
# Documentation
In continue section we will give you details for our library
## Random generator
The most important part of this project is it's single function that generates a random 32-bit integer number. We use this function to generate other kinds of random values (e.g continuous numbers between 0 and 1). This function uses the SHA-1 function and generates a random value to its corresponding seed.
